In reviewing the seasonal data for the years between 2010 & 2017, there are a few recommendations on additional research that can be made to ensure the surf/ice cream shop can be a long lasting business.

Overall, the temperature & precipitation doesn't vary too much between the months of July & December. However, it is clear that the temperature in December is about 5 degrees cooler. Additionally, it rains at a lower frequency in December compared to July, but generally has a higher intensity of precipitation. Judging solely from this information, there may be an uptick in customers in July as a majority of days are in the 70s. December on the other hand only had 50% of the days be above 71 degrees. Keeping this in mind, the following are some recommendations on additional research

##Recommendations
1. Attempt to get data on consumer habits
  1. What weather influences surfer habits (Temperature, rain, clouds)
  2. What weather influences ice cream eating habits
  3. If reliable surfers are likely to get ice cream after surfing, or if the two areas of the shop will cater to different customer bases
2. Determine if the temperature / rain data is skewed by a certain weather station (mountain station vs beach station)
3. Procure tourism data. Determine if the amount of tourists to Oahu change between the seasons.
